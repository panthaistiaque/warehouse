# Digital Bookkeeping System for Warehouse (DBSW)

The **Digital Bookkeeping System for Warehouse (DBSW)** is an online platform designed to streamline and simplify warehouse record-keeping processes, making them more cost-effective and user-friendly. The primary objective of this project is to facilitate the efficient allocation of storage space for products within the warehouse and to enhance the searchability of deliverable product locations.

## Project Overview

To ensure a lightweight, device-friendly, flexible, and user-centric application, the initial implementation will focus on mandatory features. The project will leverage technologies such as **Java Spring Boot** for web application development, utilizing the **Thymeleaf** templating engine and **jQuery** for the frontend, and **MySQL** as the backend database. The DBSW boasts a fully responsive design, enabling users to access the platform seamlessly from various devices. The user interface and experience have been thoughtfully crafted to align with user needs and requirements.

## Key Features

The first version of the project includes four major features:

1. **Product Requisition to External Suppliers:** Warehouse managers can initiate product requisition or orders to external suppliers through the system.

2. **Receipt and Storage:** The system facilitates the receipt and storage of products within the warehouse, optimizing space allocation.

3. **Delivery:** Warehouse managers can submit delivery requests for products to be sent out from the warehouse.

4. **System Administration and Email Notifications:** System administration tasks are enabled, along with email notifications to external partners regarding product orders.

## User Access and Roles

- Unregistered users are restricted from accessing any system features.
- System administrators have the authority to create new users.
- Warehouse managers have full control over the system. They can perform actions such as adding products, initiating product requests, initiating product receipt, and making delivery requests.

## Collaborative Workflow

- Upon submission of a product request by the warehouse manager, external partners or suppliers receive email notifications containing the order details.
- External suppliers can verify and approve delivery requests by clicking on secure links within the email notifications.
- Warehouse managers oversee the management of product receipt and delivery operations.
- Warehouse staff members handle the execution of product receipt and delivery operations.
- The system automates space allocation upon product receipt and identifies the optimal storage location for product rollout.

## Project Goal

The overarching goal of developing the Digital Bookkeeping System for Warehouses is to optimize warehouse operations and costs. This optimization takes into consideration critical factors such as space utilization, time efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

The DBSW project aims to revolutionize warehouse management by offering a comprehensive digital solution that enhances operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness while prioritizing space, time, and cost factors.
